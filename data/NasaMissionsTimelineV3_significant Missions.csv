1920,6,11,,,,,,,The NACA's First Wind Tunnel,"The Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory was the first facility built by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). Langley would be the only NACA test facility until the 1940s and it was home to some of the most advanced research equipment and scientists/engineers during the golden age of aviation development. However, this reputation for excellence had very humble origins, beginning with the dedication of the first federally funded wind tunnel on June 11, 1920. In a wind tunnel, a stationary object is placed in a tube-like structure and wind is created with a fan, providing researchers an opportunity to observe airflow around the object and the aerodynamic forces that act upon it. Wind tunnels are essential to the creation and testing of aircraft, allowing for experiments on designs without posing major risks to the pilots or to the aircraft.",https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/wt_019b.jpg,NASA,"When Langley was formed, the United States was far behind Europe in aeronautical technology, and Langley’s first wind tunnel housed in Building 60 was essentially a replica of a 10-year-old British wind tunnel. The Langley tunnel, known as the 5-Foot Atmospheric Wind Tunnel was virtually obsolete even before it began operations.",,,,,
1964,8,28,08:52 UTC,,,,,,Nimbus 1,"Nimbus 1, the first in a series of second-generation meteorological research-and-development satellites, was designed to serve as a stabilized, earth-oriented platform for the testing of advanced meteorological sensor systems and for collecting meteorological data. The polar-orbiting spacecraft consisted of three major elements: (1) a sensory ring, (2) solar paddles, and (3) the control system housing. The solar paddles and the control system housing were connected to the sensory ring by a truss structure, giving the satellite the appearance of an ocean buoy.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Nimbus-A%2C_Weather_Satellite_-_GPN-2003-00034.jpg,,,,,,,
1999,12,18,,,,,,,Terra,"NASA launched the Earth Observing System's flagship satellite ""Terra,"" named for Earth, on December 18, 1999. Terra has been collecting data about Earth's changing climate. Terra carries five state-of-the-art sensors that have been studying the interactions among the Earth's atmosphere, lands, oceans, and radiant energy.",https://terra.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/13493_Terra_Applications_20Anniversary_FINAL_VX-309499_lowres.mp4,,,,,Wildfires,,
2006,4,28,,,,,,,CloudSat,"NASA launched the CloudSat and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) spacecraft to study the role that clouds and aerosols play in regulating Earth's weather, climate and air quality. Launch occurred on April 28, 2006, from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., aboard a Boeing Delta II launch vehicle. ",https://youtu.be/CfRFvG37gvQ,,,,,,,
2015,1,,,,,,,,SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive),"The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite maps global soil moisture and detects whether soils are frozen or thawed. This mission helps scientists understand the links between Earth's water, energy and carbon cycles; reduce uncertainties in predicting weather and climate; and enhance our ability to monitor and predict natural hazards such as floods and droughts.",https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/side_image/public/thumbnails/image/smap-flooding-map-cr.jpg?itok=y17lPifu,NASA/JPL-Caltech,"SMAP observed an unusual horseshoe-shaped plume of freshwater (dark blue) in the Gulf of Mexico after Texas flooding in May 2015. Louisiana is above the center of the plume, with Florida on the right and the Texas coastline at upper left.",,,Land and Vegetation,,
2020,11,21,,,,,,,Sentinel-6A Michael Freilich Jason-CS (Sentinel-6A),"The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich radar altimeter mission is part of the Copernicus Programme, with the objective of providing high-precision measurements of global sea-level in the 2020–2030 time-frame (mission launched on November 21, 2020). A secondary objective is to collect high resolution vertical profiles of temperature, using the GNSS Radio-Occultation sounding technique, to assess temperature changes in the troposphere and stratosphere and to support Numerical Weather Prediction.",https://youtu.be/3_lbADMwD7A,,,,,,,
2022,22,,,,,,,,The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT),"The SWOT mission, scheduled to launch in 2022, will provide us with new and detailed information on one of the most important resources we share – water. Led by NASA and the French space agency (CNES), SWOT will survey 90% of the Earth's surface water, observe the fine details of the ocean's surface topography, and measure how lakes, rivers, reservoirs and oceans are changing over time. By using innovative technology, SWOT will measure ocean features with 10 times the resolution of current technologies.",ban-swot-span6.jpg (1138×319) (asc-csa.gc.ca),CSA,,,,,,
2024,,,,,,,,,"Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE)","The Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission will make global ocean color measurements to provide extended data records on ocean ecology and global biogeochemistry (e.g., carbon cycle) along with polarimetry measurements to provide extended data records on clouds and aerosols. Understanding of impacts and feedbacks of the Earth system to climate are critical importance.",mission_architecture.png (1425×890) (oceansciences.org),,,,,,,
