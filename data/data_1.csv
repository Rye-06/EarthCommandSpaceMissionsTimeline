2002,3,17,,2002,3,17,,,Grace Launches,"Both GRACE satellites were launched simultaneously with a ROCKOT launch vehicle from Plesetsk/Russia on March 17, 2002. The GRACE orbit is almost polar (i=89.0°) and near circular (e<0.005) and started with an initial altitude of 500 km. The anticipated lifetime for scientific operations was 5 years. The mission is still producing highly precise measurements of Earth's gravity field over 9 years later.

2005,1,,,2005,12,,,,Amazon Basin seasonal water changes,"GRACE monitors month-to-month variations in water flowing through the Amazon Basin by measuring its effects on gravity. Orange, red and pink show where gravity is higher than average. Green, blue and purple show where gravity is lower than average.

2010,1,,,2010,12,,,,Measuring water storage in the amazon,"The amount of water stored in the Amazon basin varies from month to month, and can be monitored from space by looking at how it alters Earth's gravity field. This series of images was produced using data from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and shows month-to-month water mass changes (relative to a three-year average) over the Amazon and neighboring regions.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/179-ifxB9DxUXUCp4eung1_jlfd2SVOWv/view?usp=sharing,,,,,,
