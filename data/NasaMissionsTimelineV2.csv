2007,4,25,1:26 p.m. PDT,,,,,,Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM),"Fifty miles above the ground, Earth's highest clouds form an icy membrane at the edge of the atmosphere. AIM's mission is to study the physical and chemical processes that give rise to these mysterious polar mesospheric clouds, or PMCs.    After a flawless countdown and flight, NASA's AIM spacecraft began its two-year mission to study Earth's highest clouds. The 430-pound satellite's ride into orbit was provided by a Pegasus XL rocket. Built by Orbital Sciences, the Pegasus is a unique vehicle that begins its flight secured to the underbelly of a modified L-1011 passenger jet known as ""Stargazer."" Once the L-1011 reached an altitude of 39,000 feet, the Pegasus was released for its 10-minute powered flight into space.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS4d1FQmj-w,,,,,Atmosphere,,https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/aim/launch/index.html#.Yzi8UXbMI2x

The Aquarius instrument successfully achieved its science objectives and completed its primary three-year mission in November 2014.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xQP_B18vMw,,,,,Climate,,https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/international-spacecraft-carrying-nasa-s-aquarius-instrument-ends-operations
1976,5,4,,,,,,,LAGEOS 1 and 2,"The LAser GEOdynamic Satellite (LAGEOS) was designed by NASA and launched May 4, 1976. It was the first spacecraft dedicated exclusively to high-precision laser ranging and provided the first opportunity to acquire laser-ranging data that were not degraded by errors originating in the satellite orbit or satellite array. LAGEOS-2, based on the original LAGEOS design, was built by the Italian Space Agency and launched on October 22, 1992.",https://lageos.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/lageos.png,,,,,Continental Drift and Geodynamics,,https://lageos.gsfc.nasa.gov/
2004,,,,,,,,,Gravity Probe-B,"NASA's Gravity Probe B (GP-B) mission has confirmed two key predictions derived from Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which the spacecraft was designed to test. The experiment, launched in 2004, used four ultra-precise gyroscopes to measure the hypothesized geodetic effect, the warping of space and time around a gravitational body, and frame-dragging, the amount a spinning object pulls space and time with it as it rotates. GP-B determined both effects with unprecedented precision by pointing at a single star, IM Pegasi, while in a polar orbit around Earth.",https://www.nasa.gov/images/content/172129main_gpb-earth-300dpi%20copy.jpg,,,,,Gravity,,
2015,2,12,,,,,,,CYGNSS (Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System),"The same GPS technology that helps people get where they're going in a car will soon be used in space to impact hurricane forecasting. The technology is a key capability in a NASA mission called the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS). The CYGNSS mission will use eight micro-satellites to measure wind speeds over Earth's oceans, increasing the ability of scientists to understand and predict hurricanes. Each satellite will take information based on the signals from four GPS satellites.",https://youtu.be/-id3oqrs_pc,,,,,Hurricanes,,
2003,1,,,,,,,,"Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation (ICESat) satellite ","ICESat was launched in January 2003, as a three-year mission with a goal of returning science data for five years. It was the first mission of its kind –specifically designed to study Earth's polar regions with a space-based laser altimeter called the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System, or GLAS.",https://www.nasa.gov/images/content/429697main_greenland-226.jpg,,Scientists used ICESat data to show changes in elevation over the Greenland ice sheet between 2003 and 2006. Credit: NASA/Goddard's Scientific Visualization Studio,,,Ice,,
1992,8,10,,,,,,,TOPEX/Poseidon,"Launched in 1992, TOPEX/Poseidon was a joint venture between CNES and NASA that measured ocean surface topography to an accuracy of 4.2 cm, enabled scientists to forecast the 1997-1998 El Niño, and improved understanding of ocean circulation and its effect of global climate. While a 3-year prime mission was planned, with a 5-year store of expendables, TOPEX/Poseidon delivered an astonishing 13+ years of data from orbit. The mission ended in January 2006.",https://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBdHdFIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--b6e62314716cda10a85ba8c5f4e7b59a1d9f8cf5/Poseidon_over_Earth.jpeg,,,,,Oceans,,

2000,7,15,,2010,9,19,,,Challenging Mini-satellite Payload (CHAMP),"During its mission, Challenging Mini-satellite Payload (CHAMP) generated simultaneously highly precise gravity and magnetic field measurements for the first time. These measurements have allowed scientists to detect the spatial variations of both fields as well as their variability with time. The CHAMP mission opened a new era in geopotential research with: 1) mapping of the Earth’s global long to medium wavelength gravity field and temporal variations; 2) mapping of the Earth’s global magnetic field and temporal variations and; 3) atmosphere/ionosphere sounding. As a result, CHAMP data has applications in global climate studies, oceanography, weather forecasting, disaster research, navigation, geophysics, geodesy, and solar terrestrial physics.",https://eospso.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/sat/CHAMP.jpg,,,,,Sun and its Influence on Earth,,
